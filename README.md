# fmpytorch

A library for factorization machines in pytorch. A factorization
machine is like a linear model, except multiplicative interaction
terms between the variables are modeled as well. The input to a factorization
machine layer is a vector, and the output is a scalar. Batching is fully
supported.

This is a work in progress. Feedback and bugfixes welcome! Hopefully you
find the code useful.

## Currently supported features

Currently, only a second order factorization machine is supported. The
forward and backward passes are implemented in cython. Compared to the
autodiff solution, the cython passes run several orders of magnitude
faster. I've only tested it with python 2 at the moment.

## Installation

This package requires pytorch, numpy, and cython.

To install, you can run:

```
cd fmpytorch
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Usage

The factorization machine layers in fmpytorch can be used just like any other built-in module. Here's a simple feed-forward model

```
import torch
from fmpytorch.second_order.fm import FactorizationMachine

class MyModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(100, 50)
        self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(.5)
        self.fm = FactorizationMachine(50, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fm(x)
        return x
```

See examples/demo.py for a full working example.

## TODOs

0. Python 3 support
1. More use-cases
2. More testing
3. Make sure all of the code plays nice with torch-specific stuff, e.g., GPUs
4. Arbitrary order factorization machine support
5. Better organization
